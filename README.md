# Analyzing the Influence of Geolocation on Business Ratings
This was a project for CSE 158 FA23 offered by the University of California, San Diego. The dataset for this study is sourced from the publicly available Google Local Reviews (2021) dataset, provided by Professor Julian McAuley. To download the dataset, please visit this [link](https://datarepo.eng.ucsd.edu/mcauley_group/gdrive/googlelocal/). For this project, I created a ML model to predict business ratings based on the category of a business and its geolocation. The model is based on the K-Nearest-Neighbors algorithm.
